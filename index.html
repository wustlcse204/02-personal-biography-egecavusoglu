        <h2> Cesme, Izmir Experience </h2>
        <p> Cesme is a small vacation spot outside Izmir, a city populated over 4 million. The drive takes about an hour
          with a fairly easy road. There are tens of small coves in Cesme that people go with their cars and spend
           hours chatting. The water has a deep blue color and it's clear. There are no dangerous animals
           other than sea urchins. In the evenings me and my friends like many other people would go to <i>Alacati</i>, an antique
           neighbourhood to hang out in the bars and grab food. Home barbeques, on the other hand are just as good
           accompanied by hours of deep conversations.
